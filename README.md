# Tweet Streets

## Overview

I made a NodeJS app that emails, or texts, me anytime a tweet from PhilaStreets included the terms: suspend, collection, resume, delay.

## Todo

- clean up TwilioSMS branch + merge with main
- handle not connecting to twitter error better with timestamp
- modularize test conditions for tweet inclusion
- print one-liner status messages to the log
- make it live so you can sign up for the service? (needs diagrams, API endpoints, etc)
- only grab emails in the event of tweets
