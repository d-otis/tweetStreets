# Tweet Streets

## Overview

It should come to no surprise to anyone who has been alive for the past ten months in the U.S. that things are …different, unexpected, and dare I say: unprecedented. Due to COVID and the sudden shift for millions to work-from-home, or worse yet, surprise-you’re-unemployed, has created a monumental uptick in residential trash output. 

This led to a lot of delays here in Philadelphia that were unpredictable and often signalled by a tweet from the Streets Department that there would be delays followed by estimates of when collections would resume.

I wanted to create a NodeJS app that emails, or texts, me anytime a tweet from PhilaStreets included the terms: suspend, collection, resume, delay.

## Todo

- automatically generate ```db/ids.txt``` when it doesn't already exist.
- clean up TwilioSMS branch + merge with main
